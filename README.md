# Bootcamp module one challenge

## Description

In this project I refactored the index.html file and the style.css file. I added semantic HTML elements to the index.html file, since it was mostly composed of div elements, to make it more readable. I also added alt attributes to the non decorative images of the file, to improve the accessibility of the project. In the style.css file I removed redundant classes and renamed some of them, to make the file and classes more easy to understand. Also I added comments to both files to better identify the content they hold. All these improvements made both files appear less cluttered and more clean. The functionality of the project didnâ€™t change that much, but its files will be easier to maintain and understand by someone else.
